## Why

Code reviews are currently manual-only, which leads to missed feedback and slower iteration cycles.
Introducing GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) with Claude as the AI engine will provide immediate automated code review on every PR, catching issues earlier without blocking human reviewers.

## What Changes

- Add `.github/workflows/pr-review.md` (gh-aw agent instruction file)
- Add `.github/workflows/pr-review.lock.yml` (compiled lock file generated by `gh aw compile`)
- Add setup instructions to README: how to configure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in GitHub Secrets

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `gh-aw-pr-review`: When a PR is opened or updated, Claude reviews the diff and posts a structured review comment on the PR

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- None -->

## Impact

- **New dependency**: gh-aw CLI (`gh extension install github/gh-aw`) — runs on CI runner
- **GitHub Secrets**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be added to the repository
- **GitHub Actions permissions**: `pull-requests: write`, `contents: read`
- **Existing workflows**: No impact on `ci.yml` (independent workflow)
- **Cost**: One Claude API call per PR open/push event (proportional to diff size)
